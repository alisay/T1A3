You can see the deployed site at https://admiring-bose-441367.netlify.app/

The github repo is https://github.com/alisay/T1A3

Purpose: This website serves as a portfolio website for my professional practice as an aspiring person who makes cool stuff happen with computers. It introduces me, presents documentation from some of my past projects and hosts essays demonstrating my technical knowledge. 

Functionality / features: The user can navigate between project pages, written essays and an information page from the main homepage. In addition to text, there are images, videos, people with games, and stories to tell. Design elements are minimised to create a smooth and pleasurable user experience. 

Sitemap & Screenshots can be found in the presentation in the ppt folder. 

The target audience for this website is peers who might be assessing my portfolio as support material to an application for funding. They are professionals in the same field as me, with a good technical knowledge, who are pressed for time and therefore appreciate information being displayed in a clear and concise manner.  

The website is hand-coded in html and css and deployed using netlify.
